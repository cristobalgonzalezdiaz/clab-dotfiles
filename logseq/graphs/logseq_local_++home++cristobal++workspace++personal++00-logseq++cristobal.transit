The Chinese economy is no exception in its attempts to conserve economic and natural resources via collaborative efforts to embrace cleaner technology, green energy sources, and resource conservation management to preserve resources for future generations. This research examines the influence of cleaner technologies, green energy sources, and natural resource management on reducing greenhouse gas emissions using quarterly data for the Chinese economy from 2000Q1 to 2020Q4. The findings demonstrate that increasing demand for green energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions, hence substantiating the premise of ‘green is clean’ energy development. Additionally, optimum resource usage enhances environmental quality, corroborating the ‘resource cleaner blessing’ hypothesis. The positive link between inward foreign direct investment and greenhouse gas emissions substantiates the ‘pollution haven’ concept, according to which inward foreign direct investment uses unsustainable technology in manufacturing processes, hence degrading air quality indicators. Inadequate access to clean cooking technology and increased population density has a detrimental effect on the country’s environmental sustainability agenda, which must be corrected via sustainable regulations. The causality estimates show the feedback relationship between renewable energy demand (and economic growth) and cleaner technology, between economic growth and green energy (and inbound foreign direct investment), and between population density and economic growth (and green energy). The Impulse Response function estimates suggested that economic growth and population density would likely increase GHG emissions. In contrast, cleaner technology, green energy demand, natural resource management, and inbound foreign direct investment would likely

economies, cleaner technology, increased demand for renewable energy, and more efficient use of natural resources contribute to meeting environmental sustainability targets. The Chinese economy is no exception in its attempts to conserve economic and natural resources via collaborative efforts to embrace cleaner technology, green energy sources, and resource conservation management to preserve resources for future generations. This research examines the influence of cleaner technologies, green energy sources, and natural resource management on reducing greenhouse gas emissions using quarterly data for the Chinese economy from 2000Q1 to 2020Q4. The findings demonstrate that increasing demand for green energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions, hence substantiating the premise of ‘green is clean’ energy development. Additionally, optimum resource usage enhances environmental quality, corroborating the ‘resource cleaner blessing’ hypothesis. The positive link between inward foreign direct investment and greenhouse gas emissions substantiates the ‘pollution haven’ concept, according to which inward foreign direct investment uses unsustainable technology in manufacturing processes, hence degrading air quality indicators. Inadequate access to clean cooking technology and increased population density has a detrimental effect on the country’s environmental sustainability agenda, which must be corrected via sustainable regulations. The causality estimates show the feedback relationship between renewable energy demand (and economic growth) and cleaner technology, between economic growth and green energy (and inbound foreign direct investment), and between population density and economic growth (and green energy). The Impulse Response function estimates suggested that economic growth and population density would likely increase GHG emissions. In contrast, cleaner technology, green energy demand, natural resource management, and inbound foreign direct investment would likely d...",536870917]],["^15",[122,"^O","^16",536870917]],["^15",[122,"^F",121,536870917]],["^15",[122,"^X",110,536870917]],["^15",[122,"^V",121,536870917]],["^15",[122,"^U",95,536870917]],["^15",[122,"^U",110,536870917]],["^15",[122,"^;","~u6514989f-5739-4d76-a23a-bfc5bf21916e",536870917]],["^15",[123,"^3","date:: [[Jun 6th, 2019]]\nissue:: 6\ndoi:: https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics8060643\ntitle:: @Development of a Compatible, Low Cost and High Accurate Conservation Remote Sensing Technology for the Hygrothermal Assessment of Historic Walls\npages:: 643-643\nvolume:: 8\nitem-type:: [[journalArticle]]\naccess-date:: 2023-09-22\noriginal-title:: \"Development of a Compatible, Low Cost and High Accurate Conservation Remote Sensing Technology for the Hygrothermal Assessment of Historic Walls\"\nlanguage:: en\nurl:: https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics8060643\npublication-title:: Electronics\nauthors:: [[Elena Lucchi]], [[Luísa Dias Pereira]], [[M.

As required by the international recommendations adapted to cultural heritage (CH), this monitoring system balances CH conservation, performance aspects and economic costs using an integrated multidisciplinary approach. Electronics for measurement of environmental parameters is composed of sensor measurements, data acquisition system and data storage and communication system. Data acquisition system, equipped with standard modbus-rtu interface, is designed to run standalone and it is based on two cloned single board PCs to reduce the possibility of data loss. In order to reduce the costs, RaspberryPI single board PCs were chosen. These run a C/C++ software based on standard modbus library and designed to implement multi-client server TCP/IP to allow communication with other devices. Storage and communication systems are based on an industrial PC; it communicates with sensor measurements’ system through a modbus-TCPIP bridge. PC runs a Labview software to provide data storage on a local database and graphical user interface to properly see all acquired data. Herein, some sensing options and approaches of measurement are described, unveiling different possible ways of enhancing the retrofit of CH with adapted technology.",536870917]],["^15",[123,"^17",1695848607150,536870917]],["^15",[123,"^Z","pages/@Development of a Compatible, Low Cost and High Accurate Conservation Remote Sensing Technology for the Hygrothermal Assessment of Historic Walls.md",536870917]],["^15",[124,"^K",1695848607145,536870917]],["^15",[124,"^N",20190606,536870917]],["^15",[124,"^@",true,536870917]],["^15",[124,"^Y","jun 6th, 2019",536870917]],["^15",[124,"^11","Jun 6th, 2019",536870917]],["^15",[124,"^B",1695848607145,536870917]],["^15",[124,"^;","~u6514989f-166f-42f3-8a42-54c646822ece",536870917]],["^15",[125,"^K",1695848607147,536870917]],["^15",[125,"^@",false,536870917]],["^15",[125,"^Y","valentina frighi",536870917]],["^15",[125,"^11","Valentina Frighi",536870917]],["^15",[125,"^B",1695848607147,536870917]],["^15",[125,"^;","~u6514989f-7aac-47da-93de-b5f47a908a59",536870917]],["^15",[126,"^K",1695848607145,536870917]],["^15",[126,"^@",false,536870917]],["^15",[126,"^Y","m. andreotti",536870917]],["^15",[126,"^11","M.

As required by the international recommendations adapted to cultural heritage (CH), this monitoring system balances CH conservation, performance aspects and economic costs using an integrated multidisciplinary approach. Electronics for measurement of environmental parameters is composed of sensor measurements, data acquisition system and data storage and communication system. Data acquisition system, equipped with standard modbus-rtu interface, is designed to run standalone and it is based on two cloned single board PCs to reduce the possibility of data loss. In order to reduce the costs, RaspberryPI single board PCs were chosen. These run a C/C++ software based on standard modbus library and designed to implement multi-client server TCP/IP to allow communication with other devices. Storage and communication systems are based on an industrial PC; it communicates with sensor measurements’ system through a modbus-TCPIP bridge. PC runs a Labview software to provide data storage on a local database and graphical user interface to properly see all acquired data. Herein, some sensing options and approaches of measurement are described, unveiling different possible ways of enhancing the retrofit of CH with adapted technology.",536870917]],["^15",[135,"^O","^16",536870917]],["^15",[135,"^F",134,536870917]],["^15",[135,"^X",127,536870917]],["^15",[135,"^V",134,536870917]],["^15",[135,"^U",95,536870917]],["^15",[135,"^U",127,536870917]],["^15",[135,"^;","~u6514989f-cfc5-45ce-8e77-9ea304bb224b",536870917]],["^15",[136,"^3","date:: [[Feb 1st, 2019]]\ndoi:: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.09.031\ntitle:: @Pursuing green growth in technology firms through the connections between environmental innovation and sustainable business performance: Does service capability matter?\npages:: 8-20\nvolume:: 141\nitem-type:: [[journalArticle]]\naccess-date:: 2023-09-22\noriginal-title:: Pursuing green growth in technology firms through the connections between environmental innovation and sustainable business performance: Does service capability matter?\nlanguage:: en\nurl:: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.09.031\npublication-title:: Resources Conservation and Recycling\nauthors:: [[Yudi Fernando]], [[Charbel José Chiappetta Jabbour]], [[Wen Xin Wah]]\nlinks:: [Local library](zotero://select/library/items/ZZHUX3RH), [Web library](https://www.zotero.org/users/12505254/items/ZZHUX3RH)\n\n- [[Abstract]]\n\t- In response to greater environmental awareness among stakeholders, companies have become increasingly interested in practices such as eco-innovation. Despite the expanding literature on eco-innovation, scholars have so far paid little attention to the study of eco-innovation and its impact on business sustainability, particularly considering the mediating effect of service innovation capability. To fill this research gap, this study extends the concepts of green business by investigating an original conceptual framework, which proposes that the capacity for service innovation has a mediating effect on the relationship between sustainable organizational performance and environmental innovation. This conceptual framework is subjected to empirical testing, implemented through a survey involving 95 Malaysian firms which use green technology. Data is collected through both postal and online questionnaires and analyzed through structural equation modeling using partial least squares. Respondents for this paper were identified using the directories of MyHijau (2013) and the Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation, 2014. The results suggest that: (1) eco-innovations unlock better sustainable performance; (2) service innovation capability has a partially significant positive mediating effect; (3) service innovation capability ultimately benefits companies by allowing them to differentiate through an emphasis on value creation; (4) service capability can also act as a business strategy to create barriers to new entry by competitors. Thus, eco-innovation and service innovation capability tend to represent significant intangible resources and enable an organization to achieve long-term objectives, competitive advantage and business sustainability. To date, this is the first study relating eco-innovation, service innovation capability and sustainability performance in the Malaysian corporate context and using a specific sample of companies that make use of green technolo...",536870917]],["^15",[136,"^17",1695848607178,536870917]],["^15",[136,"^Z","pages/@Pursuing green growth in technology firms through the connections between environmental

response to greater environmental awareness among stakeholders, companies have become increasingly interested in practices such as eco-innovation. Despite the expanding literature on eco-innovation, scholars have so far paid little attention to the study of eco-innovation and its impact on business sustainability, particularly considering the mediating effect of service innovation capability. To fill this research gap, this study extends the concepts of green business by investigating an original conceptual framework, which proposes that the capacity for service innovation has a mediating effect on the relationship between sustainable organizational performance and environmental innovation. This conceptual framework is subjected to empirical testing, implemented through a survey involving 95 Malaysian firms which use green technology. Data is collected through both postal and online questionnaires and analyzed through structural equation modeling using partial least squares. Respondents for this paper were identified using the directories of MyHijau (2013) and the Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation, 2014. The results suggest that: (1) eco-innovations unlock better sustainable performance; (2) service innovation capability has a partially significant positive mediating effect; (3) service innovation capability ultimately benefits companies by allowing them to differentiate through an emphasis on value creation; (4) service capability can also act as a business strategy to create barriers to new entry by competitors. Thus, eco-innovation and service innovation capability tend to represent significant intangible resources and enable an organization to achieve long-term objectives, competitive advantage and business sustainability. To date, this is the first study relating eco-innovation, service innovation capability and sustainability performance in the Malaysian corporate context and using a specific sample of companies that make use of green technolo...",536870917]],["^15",[144,"^O","^16",536870917]],["^15",[144,"^F",143,536870917]],["^15",[144,"^X",139,536870917]],["^15",[144,"^V",143,536870917]],["^15",[144,"^U",95,536870917]],["^15",[144,"^U",139,536870917]],["^15",[144,"^;","~u6514989f-74b7-4a40-9f19-29513b132d85",536870917]],["^15",[145,"^3","date:: [[Oct 4th, 2019]]\ndoi:: https://doi.org/10.1101/785014\ntitle:: @Virtual reality as a tool for environmental conservation and fundraising\nitem-type:: [[journalArticle]]\naccess-date:: 2023-09-22\noriginal-title:: Virtual reality as a tool for environmental conservation and fundraising\nlanguage:: en\nurl:: https://doi.org/10.1101/785014\nauthors:: [[Kay M.

Non-profit organizations are increasingly marketing their causes using virtual reality and they report increased donations when VR technology is employed. In VR, users are immersed in situations intended to feel more like the real world through technology, such as 360° video screened through 3D headsets that block out visual and auditory distractions. The framing of the message as either positive or negative has long shown to have an effect on behavior, although consensus on the impact of framing has not been reached in relation to encouraging contributions to public goods. This paper focuses on field experiments used to investigate the effects of varying degrees of visual immersion and positive versus negative message framing on respondents’ contributions to a conservation charity. Participants were exposed to a five-minute underwater film about coral reefs and the importance of protecting them. We employed a 2×2 experimental design using 3D head-mounted displays comparing 360° film footage vs. unidirectional film and a positive message vs. a negative message. After watching the film, each participant completed a short questionnaire and had the opportunity to donate to a marine conservation charity. In addition, we tested a control treatment where no video was observed. The video was filmed in Indonesia which is host to some of the world’s most biodiverse reefs that are under great threat from human activity. We also conducted the study in Indonesia, sampling a total of 1006 participants from the Bogor city area and tourists on the island of Gili Trawangan - which is popular for scuba diving and snorkeling. We find significant differences in observed behavior and reported emotions between all treatments compared to the control condition.
