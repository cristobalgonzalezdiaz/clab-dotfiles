The Chinese economy is no exception in its attempts to conserve economic and natural resources via collaborative efforts to embrace cleaner technology, green energy sources, and resource conservation management to preserve resources for future generations. This research examines the influence of cleaner technologies, green energy sources, and natural resource management on reducing greenhouse gas emissions using quarterly data for the Chinese economy from 2000Q1 to 2020Q4. The findings demonstrate that increasing demand for green energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions, hence substantiating the premise of ‘green is clean’ energy development. Additionally, optimum resource usage enhances environmental quality, corroborating the ‘resource cleaner blessing’ hypothesis. The positive link between inward foreign direct investment and greenhouse gas emissions substantiates the ‘pollution haven’ concept, according to which inward foreign direct investment uses unsustainable technology in manufacturing processes, hence degrading air quality indicators. Inadequate access to clean cooking technology and increased population density has a detrimental effect on the country’s environmental sustainability agenda, which must be corrected via sustainable regulations. The causality estimates show the feedback relationship between renewable energy demand (and economic growth) and cleaner technology, between economic growth and green energy (and inbound foreign direct investment), and between population density and economic growth (and green energy). The Impulse Response function estimates suggested that economic growth and population density would likely increase GHG emissions. In contrast, cleaner technology, green energy demand, natural resource management, and inbound foreign direct investment would likely

economies, cleaner technology, increased demand for renewable energy, and more efficient use of natural resources contribute to meeting environmental sustainability targets. The Chinese economy is no exception in its attempts to conserve economic and natural resources via collaborative efforts to embrace cleaner technology, green energy sources, and resource conservation management to preserve resources for future generations. This research examines the influence of cleaner technologies, green energy sources, and natural resource management on reducing greenhouse gas emissions using quarterly data for the Chinese economy from 2000Q1 to 2020Q4. The findings demonstrate that increasing demand for green energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions, hence substantiating the premise of ‘green is clean’ energy development. Additionally, optimum resource usage enhances environmental quality, corroborating the ‘resource cleaner blessing’ hypothesis. The positive link between inward foreign direct investment and greenhouse gas emissions substantiates the ‘pollution haven’ concept, according to which inward foreign direct investment uses unsustainable technology in manufacturing processes, hence degrading air quality indicators. Inadequate access to clean cooking technology and increased population density has a detrimental effect on the country’s environmental sustainability agenda, which must be corrected via sustainable regulations. The causality estimates show the feedback relationship between renewable energy demand (and economic growth) and cleaner technology, between economic growth and green energy (and inbound foreign direct investment), and between population density and economic growth (and green energy). The Impulse Response function estimates suggested that economic growth and population density would likely increase GHG emissions. In contrast, cleaner technology, green energy demand, natural resource management, and inbound foreign direct investment would likely d...",536870917]],["^15",[122,"^O","^16",536870917]],["^15",[122,"^F",121,536870917]],["^15",[122,"^X",110,536870917]],["^15",[122,"^V",121,536870917]],["^15",[122,"^U",95,536870917]],["^15",[122,"^U",110,536870917]],["^15",[122,"^;","~u6514989f-5739-4d76-a23a-bfc5bf21916e",536870917]],["^15",[123,"^3","date:: [[Jun 6th, 2019]]\nissue:: 6\ndoi:: https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics8060643\ntitle:: @Development of a Compatible, Low Cost and High Accurate Conservation Remote Sensing Technology for the Hygrothermal Assessment of Historic Walls\npages:: 643-643\nvolume:: 8\nitem-type:: [[journalArticle]]\naccess-date:: 2023-09-22\noriginal-title:: \"Development of a Compatible, Low Cost and High Accurate Conservation Remote Sensing Technology for the Hygrothermal Assessment of Historic Walls\"\nlanguage:: en\nurl:: https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics8060643\npublication-title:: Electronics\nauthors:: [[Elena Lucchi]], [[Luísa Dias Pereira]], [[M.

As required by the international recommendations adapted to cultural heritage (CH), this monitoring system balances CH conservation, performance aspects and economic costs using an integrated multidisciplinary approach. Electronics for measurement of environmental parameters is composed of sensor measurements, data acquisition system and data storage and communication system. Data acquisition system, equipped with standard modbus-rtu interface, is designed to run standalone and it is based on two cloned single board PCs to reduce the possibility of data loss. In order to reduce the costs, RaspberryPI single board PCs were chosen. These run a C/C++ software based on standard modbus library and designed to implement multi-client server TCP/IP to allow communication with other devices. Storage and communication systems are based on an industrial PC; it communicates with sensor measurements’ system through a modbus-TCPIP bridge. PC runs a Labview software to provide data storage on a local database and graphical user interface to properly see all acquired data. Herein, some sensing options and approaches of measurement are described, unveiling different possible ways of enhancing the retrofit of CH with adapted technology.",536870917]],["^15",[123,"^17",1695848607150,536870917]],["^15",[123,"^Z","pages/@Development of a Compatible, Low Cost and High Accurate Conservation Remote Sensing Technology for the Hygrothermal Assessment of Historic Walls.md",536870917]],["^15",[124,"^K",1695848607145,536870917]],["^15",[124,"^N",20190606,536870917]],["^15",[124,"^@",true,536870917]],["^15",[124,"^Y","jun 6th, 2019",536870917]],["^15",[124,"^11","Jun 6th, 2019",536870917]],["^15",[124,"^B",1695848607145,536870917]],["^15",[124,"^;","~u6514989f-166f-42f3-8a42-54c646822ece",536870917]],["^15",[125,"^K",1695848607147,536870917]],["^15",[125,"^@",false,536870917]],["^15",[125,"^Y","valentina frighi",536870917]],["^15",[125,"^11","Valentina Frighi",536870917]],["^15",[125,"^B",1695848607147,536870917]],["^15",[125,"^;","~u6514989f-7aac-47da-93de-b5f47a908a59",536870917]],["^15",[126,"^K",1695848607145,536870917]],["^15",[126,"^@",false,536870917]],["^15",[126,"^Y","m. andreotti",536870917]],["^15",[126,"^11","M.

As required by the international recommendations adapted to cultural heritage (CH), this monitoring system balances CH conservation, performance aspects and economic costs using an integrated multidisciplinary approach. Electronics for measurement of environmental parameters is composed of sensor measurements, data acquisition system and data storage and communication system. Data acquisition system, equipped with standard modbus-rtu interface, is designed to run standalone and it is based on two cloned single board PCs to reduce the possibility of data loss. In order to reduce the costs, RaspberryPI single board PCs were chosen. These run a C/C++ software based on standard modbus library and designed to implement multi-client server TCP/IP to allow communication with other devices. Storage and communication systems are based on an industrial PC; it communicates with sensor measurements’ system through a modbus-TCPIP bridge. PC runs a Labview software to provide data storage on a local database and graphical user interface to properly see all acquired data. Herein, some sensing options and approaches of measurement are described, unveiling different possible ways of enhancing the retrofit of CH with adapted technology.",536870917]],["^15",[135,"^O","^16",536870917]],["^15",[135,"^F",134,536870917]],["^15",[135,"^X",127,536870917]],["^15",[135,"^V",134,536870917]],["^15",[135,"^U",95,536870917]],["^15",[135,"^U",127,536870917]],["^15",[135,"^;","~u6514989f-cfc5-45ce-8e77-9ea304bb224b",536870917]],["^15",[136,"^3","date:: [[Feb 1st, 2019]]\ndoi:: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.09.031\ntitle:: @Pursuing green growth in technology firms through the connections between environmental innovation and sustainable business performance: Does service capability matter?\npages:: 8-20\nvolume:: 141\nitem-type:: [[journalArticle]]\naccess-date:: 2023-09-22\noriginal-title:: Pursuing green growth in technology firms through the connections between environmental innovation and sustainable business performance: Does service capability matter?\nlanguage:: en\nurl:: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.09.031\npublication-title:: Resources Conservation and Recycling\nauthors:: [[Yudi Fernando]], [[Charbel José Chiappetta Jabbour]], [[Wen Xin Wah]]\nlinks:: [Local library](zotero://select/library/items/ZZHUX3RH), [Web library](https://www.zotero.org/users/12505254/items/ZZHUX3RH)\n\n- [[Abstract]]\n\t- In response to greater environmental awareness among stakeholders, companies have become increasingly interested in practices such as eco-innovation. Despite the expanding literature on eco-innovation, scholars have so far paid little attention to the study of eco-innovation and its impact on business sustainability, particularly considering the mediating effect of service innovation capability. To fill this research gap, this study extends the concepts of green business by investigating an original conceptual framework, which proposes that the capacity for service innovation has a mediating effect on the relationship between sustainable organizational performance and environmental innovation. This conceptual framework is subjected to empirical testing, implemented through a survey involving 95 Malaysian firms which use green technology. Data is collected through both postal and online questionnaires and analyzed through structural equation modeling using partial least squares. Respondents for this paper were identified using the directories of MyHijau (2013) and the Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation, 2014. The results suggest that: (1) eco-innovations unlock better sustainable performance; (2) service innovation capability has a partially significant positive mediating effect; (3) service innovation capability ultimately benefits companies by allowing them to differentiate through an emphasis on value creation; (4) service capability can also act as a business strategy to create barriers to new entry by competitors. Thus, eco-innovation and service innovation capability tend to represent significant intangible resources and enable an organization to achieve long-term objectives, competitive advantage and business sustainability. To date, this is the first study relating eco-innovation, service innovation capability and sustainability performance in the Malaysian corporate context and using a specific sample of companies that make use of green technolo...",536870917]],["^15",[136,"^17",1695848607178,536870917]],["^15",[136,"^Z","pages/@Pursuing green growth in technology firms through the connections between environmental

response to greater environmental awareness among stakeholders, companies have become increasingly interested in practices such as eco-innovation. Despite the expanding literature on eco-innovation, scholars have so far paid little attention to the study of eco-innovation and its impact on business sustainability, particularly considering the mediating effect of service innovation capability. To fill this research gap, this study extends the concepts of green business by investigating an original conceptual framework, which proposes that the capacity for service innovation has a mediating effect on the relationship between sustainable organizational performance and environmental innovation. This conceptual framework is subjected to empirical testing, implemented through a survey involving 95 Malaysian firms which use green technology. Data is collected through both postal and online questionnaires and analyzed through structural equation modeling using partial least squares. Respondents for this paper were identified using the directories of MyHijau (2013) and the Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation, 2014. The results suggest that: (1) eco-innovations unlock better sustainable performance; (2) service innovation capability has a partially significant positive mediating effect; (3) service innovation capability ultimately benefits companies by allowing them to differentiate through an emphasis on value creation; (4) service capability can also act as a business strategy to create barriers to new entry by competitors. Thus, eco-innovation and service innovation capability tend to represent significant intangible resources and enable an organization to achieve long-term objectives, competitive advantage and business sustainability. To date, this is the first study relating eco-innovation, service innovation capability and sustainability performance in the Malaysian corporate context and using a specific sample of companies that make use of green technolo...",536870917]],["^15",[144,"^O","^16",536870917]],["^15",[144,"^F",143,536870917]],["^15",[144,"^X",139,536870917]],["^15",[144,"^V",143,536870917]],["^15",[144,"^U",95,536870917]],["^15",[144,"^U",139,536870917]],["^15",[144,"^;","~u6514989f-74b7-4a40-9f19-29513b132d85",536870917]],["^15",[145,"^3","date:: [[Oct 4th, 2019]]\ndoi:: https://doi.org/10.1101/785014\ntitle:: @Virtual reality as a tool for environmental conservation and fundraising\nitem-type:: [[journalArticle]]\naccess-date:: 2023-09-22\noriginal-title:: Virtual reality as a tool for environmental conservation and fundraising\nlanguage:: en\nurl:: https://doi.org/10.1101/785014\nauthors:: [[Kay M.

Non-profit organizations are increasingly marketing their causes using virtual reality and they report increased donations when VR technology is employed. In VR, users are immersed in situations intended to feel more like the real world through technology, such as 360° video screened through 3D headsets that block out visual and auditory distractions. The framing of the message as either positive or negative has long shown to have an effect on behavior, although consensus on the impact of framing has not been reached in relation to encouraging contributions to public goods. This paper focuses on field experiments used to investigate the effects of varying degrees of visual immersion and positive versus negative message framing on respondents’ contributions to a conservation charity. Participants were exposed to a five-minute underwater film about coral reefs and the importance of protecting them. We employed a 2×2 experimental design using 3D head-mounted displays comparing 360° film footage vs. unidirectional film and a positive message vs. a negative message. After watching the film, each participant completed a short questionnaire and had the opportunity to donate to a marine conservation charity. In addition, we tested a control treatment where no video was observed. The video was filmed in Indonesia which is host to some of the world’s most biodiverse reefs that are under great threat from human activity. We also conducted the study in Indonesia, sampling a total of 1006 participants from the Bogor city area and tourists on the island of Gili Trawangan - which is popular for scuba diving and snorkeling. We find significant differences in observed behavior and reported emotions between all treatments compared to the control condition.

[[BRIEF SDM404 ASSESSMENT 2-A]]\n- ### [[Software Document Proposal]]\n\t- #### [[Title]]\n\t\t-\n\t- #### [[Problem Description]]\n\t\t- The operations of Natural Resources Management Companies have been steadily increasing over the years. The government budgets allocated to these companies have surpassed 1.100 billion in the last decade, with an annual growth rate of 6 per cent.\n\t\t  \n\t\t  The industry faces various challenges, and efficient operations have become crucial to the overall process. Having the necessary equipment and maintaining it in optimal condition is essential to meet customer requirements and ensure client satisfaction.\n\t\t  \n\t\t  We propose a software solution that enhances the Assets Control Process to address these challenges. The software will establish a new interface between the Inventory Management System and the Operations Crew responsible for conducting fieldwork.\n\t\t  \n\t\t  In the past, we have worked with several clients facing similar challenges. For instance, we developed a customised inventory management system for a leading mining company that reduced equipment downtime by 30%. We also created a predictive maintenance module for a forestry company that helped them reduce maintenance costs by 20%. Leveraging our experience and expertise, we aim to create a solution that addresses your immediate needs and provides a foundation for future growth and efficiency.\n\t\t  \n\t\t  In terms of high-level design, the proposed software will be capable of accessing a connected database or ledger of assets and users to perform different functions. These functions include Reservation, Borrowing, Log Transactions, and Reporting. These new features will enhance asset flow control and optimise the assignment of assets.\n\t- #### [[Proposed Solution]]\n\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t- #### PROPOSED SOLUTION\n\t\t\t- Our solution aims to solve the most common and critical problems organisations face when dealing with Asset Control and Management, such as:\n\t\t\t      • Stolen Assets\n\t\t\t      • Responsibility Assignment\n\t\t\t      • Difficulty in tracking and monitoring assets\n\t\t\t      • Lack of reports and analysis\n\t\t\t  The system will implement a tracking mechanism to combat stolen assets that logs all movements with unique identifiers. When assets are checked out or borrowed, details will be recorded, facilitating the tracking of stolen assets and accountability. Responsibility assignment will be streamlined with a record of asset custodians, enhancing accountability and early issue detection. Asset tracking and monitoring are made efficient with real-time visibility through unique identifiers.\n\t- #### [[Project Plan]]",536870936]],["^15",[472,"^17",1700524479389,536870936]],["^15",[472,"^1C","~m1697919419850",536870937]],["^15",[472,"^Z","pages/Assessment 2 Part A.md",536870936]],["^15",[473,"^K",1700524479387,536870936]],["^15",[473,"^[",472,536870936]],["^15",[473,"^@",false,536870936]],["^15",[473,"^Y","assessment 2 part a",536870936]],["^15",[473,"^11","Assessment 2 Part A",536870936]],["^15",[473,"^B",1700524479387,536870936]],["^15",[473,"^;","~u655bf1bf-5c02-446d-83ea-7d23abb53682",536870938]],["^15",[474,"^K",1700524479387,536870936]],["^15",[474,"^@",false,536870936]],["^15",[474,"^Y","brief sdm404 assessment 2-a",536870936]],["^15",[474,"^11","BRIEF SDM404 ASSESSMENT 2-A",536870936]],["^15",[474,"^B",1700524479387,536870936]],["^15",[474,"^;","~u655bf1bf-cd0f-4c8a-aed8-0a575fe22218",536870938]],["^15",[475,"^K",1700524479388,536870936]],["^15",[475,"^@",false,536870936]],["^15",[475,"^Y","software document proposal",536870936]],["^15",[475,"^11","Software Document Proposal",536870936]],["^15",[475,"^B",1700524479388,536870936]],["^15",[475,"^;","~u655bf1bf-64f5-4bb8-96a5-1cf4b6afbc2c",536870936]],["^15",[476,"^K",1700524479388,536870936]],["^15",[476,"^@",false,536870936]],["^15",[476,"^Y","title",536870936]],["^15",[476,"^11","Title",536870936]],["^15",[476,"^B",1700524479388,536870936]],["^15",[476,"^;","~u655bf1bf-fd3b-4b09-8826-457ac024ed50",536870936]],["^15",[477,"^K",1700524479389,536870936]],["^15",[477,"^@",false,536870936]],["^15",[477,"^Y","problem description",536870936]],["^15",[477,"^11","Problem Description",536870936]],["^15",[477,"^B",1700524479389,536870936]],["^15",[477,"^;","~u655bf1bf-339b-4948-a38f-7161894c2a7e",536870936]],["^15",[478,"^K",1700524479389,536870936]],["^15",[478,"^@",false,536870936]],["^15",[478,"^Y","proposed solution",536870936]],["^15",[478,"^11","Proposed Solution",536870936]],["^15",[478,"^B",1700524479389,536870936]],["^15",[478,"^;","~u655bf1bf-2d79-498e-857e-331209eb7216",536870936]],["^15",[479,"^K",1700524479389,536870936]],["^15",[479,"^@",false,536870936]],["^15",[479,"^Y","project plan",536870936]],["^15",[479,"^11","Project Plan",536870936]],["^15",[479,"^B",1700524479389,536870936]],["^15",[479,"^;","~u655bf1bf-423e-4b19-95af-a4729a528298",536870936]],["^15",[480,"^Q","The operations of Natural Resources Management Companies have been steadily increasing over the years.

You will need to be able to identify a certain problem in the scenario given to you, find the main reason for that problem and propose a solution(s) to the problem that shows your understanding of different project management practises and approaches. You need to be able to justify your choice for the solution proposed. All assessments for SDM404 are integrated to help develop your skills in producing high quality software solutions in time and within budget. This assessment will help not only identify major problems that could happen during any software development project, but try to find causes and solutions to these problems in order to be able to complete the project successfully. .\n  ls-type:: annotation\n  hl-page:: 1\n  hl-color:: yellow\n  id:: 651601a3-3ab6-4cc3-87ef-f36128c1736b\n- [:span]\n  ls-type:: annotation\n  hl-page:: 1\n  hl-color:: yellow\n  id:: 651601e5-42d5-45bb-816d-8f7e0512b98b\n  hl-type:: area\n  hl-stamp:: 1695941093618\n- ls-type:: annotation\n  hl-page:: 1\n  hl-color:: yellow\n  id:: 65158202-cbdd-4b84-96d8-b24a79b1e92a\n  1.

For each of the different solutions try to think about what resources you will need, how much time you need to prepare it, the cost, and what risks might slow down your progress.● Choose one of these solutions and base your proposal on it. Keeping in mind cost, resources, and time.\n  ls-type:: annotation\n  hl-page:: 2\n  hl-color:: yellow\n  id:: 65338696-3e47-40ee-b3a3-32317ebd9b5e\n- Note: At the end of the semester, you will present an implemented software application of your proposed project.

[[Server Naming Convention Policy Document]]\nid:: 65319de9-6ba3-4964-9764-bba5f062150c\n\t- ## [[Purpose]]\n\t\t- This document aims to establish a formal naming convention for servers and other computing resources within the organization.

Summary\n  collapsed:: true\n\t- The Telstra case study focuses on the telecommunications and technology company's efforts to improve its project management capabilities. Telstra aims to create a \"brilliant, connected future for everyone\" and utilises Project Management Institute (PMI) frameworks to achieve this. The company's Global Services Practices (GSP) division, established in 2013, is responsible for delivering high-end technology consulting, design, and deployment. Despite its talent pool, Telstra identified inconsistencies in project management roles and skills. To address this, the company launched a certification program in mid-2015 for over 400 of GSP's project managers. The initiative aimed to standardise qualifications, align approaches with business goals, and improve customer satisfaction. The program has been deemed successful, contributing to Telstra's overall capability and customer satisfaction.\n\t  id:: 651b23e8-50b8-4861-80bb-8bea13794566\n- ## Highlights\n  collapsed:: true\n\t- ((65160e9d-d898-4d43-8322-3225c33e0fe9))\n\t-\n- ## [[Analysis]]\n  collapsed:: true\n\t- ### Analysis of Telstra Case Study Scenario\n\t\t- ### Introduction\n\t\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t\t- The landscape of project management is ever-evolving, particularly in technology-driven industries. Organisations are continuously striving to improve their project management practices to ensure successful project outcomes, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. One such organisation facing challenges in this domain is Telstra's Global Services Practices (GSP) division. This analysis aims to scrutinise the project management inconsistencies within Telstra's GSP division and propose a hybrid project management approach that amalgamates elements of PMI, Agile-Scrum, and PRINCE2 frameworks. The objective is to offer a comprehensive solution that not only addresses the immediate issues but also positions the division for future success in a rapidly changing industry.\n\t\t\t- The paper is structured as follows:\n\t\t\t\t- **Main Problem in the Scenario**: An in-depth analysis of the primary issue of inconsistency in project management roles and qualifications within Telstra's GSP division.\n\t\t\t\t- **Main Cause(s) for the Problem(s)**: Identification and discussion of the root cause, focusing on the lack of a standardised certification and training program for project managers.\n\t\t\t\t- **Proposed Solution(s)**: A multi-faceted solution that includes implementing a company-wide certification program, developing a standardised project management framework, and conducting regular training and development programs. Additionally, the feasibility of integrating alternative frameworks like Agile-Scrum and PRINCE2 will be explored.\n\t\t\t\t- **Implementation Plan**: A phased approach to implementing the proposed hybrid project management environment, complete with an assessment and planning phase, framework design, training and certification, and governance and oversight.\n\t\t\t\t- **Justification for the Proposed Solution**: A rationale for why the proposed hybrid approach is the most effective solution for addressing the specific issues faced by Telstra's GSP division.\n\t\t\t\t- **Adaptability to Industry Changes**: An examination of how the proposed solution is adaptable to the rapid changes and advancements in the technology industry.\n\t\t\t\t- **Alignment with Future Vision**: A discussion on how the proposed solution aligns with Telstra's long-term strategic objectives and vision.\n\t\t\t- By conducting this analysis, the paper aims to provide a well-rounded view of the challenges and potential solutions for improving project management practices within Telstra's GSP division. The proposed solutions are not only designed to address the current issues but also to provide a robust framework that is adaptable to future industry changes and aligns with the company's long-term strategic goals.\n\t\t- ### 1. Main Problem(s) in the Scenario\n\t\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t\t- The primary problem in the scenario is the inconsistency in project management roles and qualifications across Telstra's GSP division. This inconsistency leads to variable project outcomes and customer satisfaction levels.:\n\t\t\t\t- **Variable Skill Levels**: Project managers within the division come from diverse backgrounds, including engineering and technical fields. While this diversity can be a strength, it also means that not all project managers possess the same level of expertise in project management methodologies and practices.\n\t\t\t\t  **Lack of Standardisation**: The absence of a uniform certification or training program has led to a lack of standardisation in project management approaches. This results in different project managers using different methodologies, even when working on similar types of projects.\n\t\t\t\t  **Inconsistent Project Outcomes**: Due to the above factors, the quality of project outcomes varies significantly. Some projects may be executed flawlessly, while others may face delays, budget overruns, or quality issues.\n\t\t\t\t  **Fluctuating Customer Satisfaction**: The inconsistency in project outcomes directly impacts customer satisfaction. Clients may receive different levels of service quality depending on the project manager assigned, leading to an unpredictable customer experience.\n\t\t\t\t  **Operational Inefficiencies**: The lack of standardisation also creates operational inefficiencies. Resources may not be utilised optimally, and the absence of a common framework can lead to communication gaps within the team and with stakeholders.\n\t\t\t\t  **Strategic Misalignment**: The inconsistency in project management practices can also result in projects that are not fully aligned with Telstra's strategic goals, thereby affecting the company's long-term objectives.\n\t\t\t\t  **Reputational Risk**: Inconsistent project outcomes and fluctuating customer satisfaction levels can harm Telstra's reputation in the long run, affecting its competitive positioning in the market.\n\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t  In summary, the inconsistency in project management roles and qualifications within Telstra's GSP division is a multifaceted problem that has far-reaching implications. It affects not just the quality of individual projects but also impacts operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and the company's long-term strategic goals.\n\t\t- ### 2. Main Cause(s) for the Problem(s)\n\t\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t\t- **Main Cause**: Lack of Standardised Certification and Training Program\n\t\t\t\t- The root cause of the inconsistency in project management roles and qualifications within Telstra Global Services Practices (GSP) division can be traced back to the absence of a standardised certification and training program for project managers. This lack of standardisation manifests in several detrimental ways:\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t\t- **Diverse Skill Sets:** Without a standardised training program, project managers come into the role with varying levels of expertise and from diverse professional backgrounds. While some may have formal project management training, others may have transitioned from technical or engineering roles. This diversity, although potentially enriching, creates a lack of uniformity in skill sets (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n\t\t\t\t  **Inconsistent Methodologies**: The absence of a standardised certification program means that there is no common methodology or set of best practices that all project managers are required to follow. This leads to inconsistencies in how projects are planned, executed, and closed, affecting the quality and outcomes of these projects (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n\t\t\t\t  **Quality Variability:** The lack of a uniform skill set and methodology among project managers results in variable quality in project delivery. Some projects may meet all objectives, while others may suffer from delays, cost overruns, or other issues (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n\t\t\t\t  **Operational Complexity:** Without standardisation, the operational process becomes complex. Different project managers may use different tools, templates, and reporting structures, making it difficult for the organisation to streamline operations and improve efficiency (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n\t\t\t\t  **Strategic Misalignment:** A lack of standardised training and certification can also lead to projects that are not aligned with the company's strategic objectives. Project managers may prioritise different aspects of a project based on their individual understanding and experience, which may not necessarily align with the company's goals (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n\t\t\t\t  **Reputational Risk:** The variability in project outcomes due to the lack of standardisation can lead to customer dissatisfaction, which poses a reputational risk for Telstra. Inconsistent project delivery can result in negative customer reviews and loss of business (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n\t\t- ### 3. Proposed Solution(s)\n\t\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t\t- To address the root cause of the problem, which is the lack of a standardised certification and training program for project managers, the following solutions are proposed:\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- ### Implement a Company-wide Certification Program for Project Managers:\n\t\t\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t\t\t- Rationale: A certification program would ensure that all project managers meet a minimum standard of knowledge and skill. This would bring uniformity in project management practices across the division (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n\t\t\t\t- Implementation: Partner with a globally recognised body like the Project Management Institute (PMI) to provide certification courses. Make it mandatory for all project managers to be certified within a specific timeframe.\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- ### Develop a Standardised Project Management Framework:\n\t\t\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t\t\t- Rationale: A standardised framework would provide a common methodology and set of best practices for project managers to follow. This would ensure consistency in project planning, execution, and closure (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n\t\t\t\t- Implementation: Form a committee of senior project managers and stakeholders to develop the framework. Once developed, roll it out across the division through workshops and training sessions.\n\t\t\t- ### Conduct Regular Training and Development Programs:\n\t\t\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t\t\t- Rationale: Ongoing training ensures that project managers are up-to-date with the latest industry trends and methodologies. This would contribute to continuous improvement in project delivery (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n\t\t\t\t- Implementation: Establish a yearly training calendar that includes a mix of internal and external training programs. Make completion of a certain number of training hours mandatory for all project managers.\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- ### Alternative Frameworks and Harmonisation with PMI\n\t\t\t\t- In addition to the previously mentioned solutions, alternative project management frameworks like Agile-Scrum and PRINCE2 could also be considered. Here's how:\n\t\t\t- collapsed:: true\n\t\t\t\t- #### 1. Agile-Scrum Framework\n\t\t\t\t\t- Rationale: Agile-Scrum is particularly effective for projects that are complex and subject to rapid changes. It allows for greater flexibility and can improve team collaboration (Schwaber & Sutherland, 2020).\n\t\t\t\t\t- Implementation: Train project managers and team members in Scrum methodologies. Implement Scrum rituals like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and sprint reviews.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Harmonisation with PMI: PMI's Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP) could be integrated into the training program to ensure that Agile practices are aligned with PMI standards.\n\t\t\t\t- #### 2. PRINCE2 Framework\n\t\t\t\t  collapsed:: true\n\t\t\t\t\t- Rationale: PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments) is a process-driven project management method that provides a step-by-step approach to project delivery (Office of Government Commerce, 2009).\n\t\t\t\t\t- Implementation: Train project managers in PRINCE2 methodologies and make it mandatory for them to attain PRINCE2 certification.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Harmonisation with PMI: PRINCE2's focus on process can complement PMI's PMBOK's (Project Management Body of Knowledge) focus on knowledge areas. A combined PRINCE2 and PMP (Project Management Professional) training could provide a comprehensive skill set.\n\t\t\t- ### Harmonising Multiple Frameworks\n\t\t\t\t- Rationale: Utilising multiple frameworks can provide a more versatile and robust project management approach.\n\t\t\t\t- Implementation: Develop a hybrid framework that incorporates elements of PMI, Agile-Scrum, and PRINCE2. Train project managers in this hybrid approach to ensure they can adapt to various project requirements.\n\t\t- ### 4.

While some may have formal project management training, others may have transitioned from technical or engineering roles. This diversity, although potentially enriching, creates a lack of uniformity in skill sets (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n**Inconsistent Methodologies**: The absence of a standardised certification program means that there is no common methodology or set of best practices that all project managers are required to follow. This leads to inconsistencies in how projects are planned, executed, and closed, affecting the quality and outcomes of these projects (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n**Quality Variability:** The lack of a uniform skill set and methodology among project managers results in variable quality in project delivery. Some projects may meet all objectives, while others may suffer from delays, cost overruns, or other issues (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n**Operational Complexity:** Without standardisation, the operational process becomes complex. Different project managers may use different tools, templates, and reporting structures, making it difficult for the organisation to streamline operations and improve efficiency (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n**Strategic Misalignment:** A lack of standardised training and certification can also lead to projects that are not aligned with the company's strategic objectives. Project managers may prioritise different aspects of a project based on their individual understanding and experience, which may not necessarily align with the company's goals (Project Management Institute, 2016).\n**Reputational Risk:** The variability in project outcomes due to the lack of standardisation can lead to customer dissatisfaction, which poses a reputational risk for Telstra. Inconsistent project delivery can result in negative customer reviews and loss of business (Project Management Institute, 2016).",536870965]],["^15",[659,"^O","^16",536870965]],["^15",[659,"^F",717,536870965]],["^15",[659,"^X",491,536870965]],["^15",[659,"^V",717,536870965]],["^15",[659,"^U",491,536870965]],["^15",[659,"^U",632,536870965]],["^15",[659,"^;","~u655bf1bf-a3b3-4c07-90f0-b40cd4111633",536870965]],["^15",[660,"^Q","Implementation: Train project managers and team members in Scrum methodologies.

The company's Global Services Practices (GSP) division, established in 2013, is responsible for delivering high-end technology consulting, design, and deployment. Despite its talent pool, Telstra identified inconsistencies in project management roles and skills. To address this, the company launched a certification program in mid-2015 for over 400 of GSP's project managers. The initiative aimed to standardise qualifications, align approaches with business goals, and improve customer satisfaction. The program has been deemed successful, contributing to Telstra's overall capability and customer satisfaction.\nid:: 651b23e8-50b8-4861-80bb-8bea13794566",536870965]],["^15",[673,"^O","^16",536870965]],["^15",[673,"^F",657,536870965]],["^15",[673,"^X",491,536870965]],["^15",[673,"^V",657,536870965]],["^15",[673,"^U",491,536870965]],["^15",[673,"^?",["^ ","^2B","651b23e8-50b8-4861-80bb-8bea13794566"],536870965]],["^15",[673,"^J",["^2B"],536870965]],["^15",[673,"^4",["^ ","^2B","651b23e8-50b8-4861-80bb-8bea13794566"],536870965]],["^15",[673,"^;","~u651b23e8-50b8-4861-80bb-8bea13794566",536870965]],["^15",[674,"^Q","**Monitoring and Feedback**: Continuously monitor these projects and collect feedback for improvement.",536870965]],["^15",[674,"^O","^16",536870965]],["^15",[674,"^F",677,536870965]],["^15",[674,"^X",491,536870965]],["^15",[674,"^V",666,536870965]],["^15",[674,"^U",491,536870965]],["^15",[674,"^U",632,536870965]],["^15",[674,"^;","~u655bf1bf-b883-49a2-ae43-328ced7e8545",536870965]],["^15",[675,"^Q","**Solution**: The hybrid approach's focus on standardisation, flexibility, and governance aims to improve project outcomes and customer satisfaction.",536870965]],["^15",[675,"^O","^16",536870965]],["^15",[675,"^F",692,536870965]],["^15",[675,"^X",491,536870965]],["^15",[675,"^V",692,536870965]],["^15",[675,"^U",491,536870965]],["^15",[675,"^U",632,536870965]],["^15",[675,"^;","~u655bf1bf-f626-4ec7-89dd-95b02c89fd7c",536870965]],["^15",[676,"^Q","**2.

This results in different project managers using different methodologies, even when working on similar types of projects.\n**Inconsistent Project Outcomes**: Due to the above factors, the quality of project outcomes varies significantly. Some projects may be executed flawlessly, while others may face delays, budget overruns, or quality issues.\n**Fluctuating Customer Satisfaction**: The inconsistency in project outcomes directly impacts customer satisfaction. Clients may receive different levels of service quality depending on the project manager assigned, leading to an unpredictable customer experience.\n**Operational Inefficiencies**: The lack of standardisation also creates operational inefficiencies. Resources may not be utilised optimally, and the absence of a common framework can lead to communication gaps within the team and with stakeholders.\n**Strategic Misalignment**: The inconsistency in project management practices can also result in projects that are not fully aligned with Telstra's strategic goals, thereby affecting the company's long-term objectives.\n**Reputational Risk**: Inconsistent project outcomes and fluctuating customer satisfaction levels can harm Telstra's reputation in the long run, affecting its competitive positioning in the market.\n\nIn summary, the inconsistency in project management roles and qualifications within Telstra's GSP division is a multifaceted problem that has far-reaching implications.

assessment will help you develop your analytical and problem solving skills. You will need to be able to identify a certain problem in the scenario given to you, find the main reason for that problem and propose a solution(s) to the problem that shows your understanding of different project management practises and approaches. You need to be able to justify your choice for the solution proposed. All assessments for SDM404 are integrated to help develop your skills in producing high quality software solutions in time and within budget. This assessment will help not only identify major problems that could happen during any software development project, but try to find causes and solutions to these problems in order to be able to complete the project successfully. .\"},\n               :properties {:color \"yellow\"}}\n              {:id #uuid \"651601e5-42d5-45bb-816d-8f7e0512b98b\",\n               :page 1,\n               :position {:bounding {:x1 99,\n                                     :y1 560,\n                                     :x2 688,\n                                     :y2 662,\n                                     :width 800.0000000000001,\n                                     :height 1131.3848014513203},\n                          :rects (),\n                          :page 1},\n               :content {:text \"[:span]\", :image 1695941093618},\n               :properties {:color \"yellow\"}}],\n :extra {:page 1}}\n",536870969]],["^15",[752,"^17",1700524479922,536870969]],["^15",[752,"^1C","~m1695941098516",536870970]],["^15",[752,"^Z","assets/SDM404_Assessment_1_CaseStudy_module_3_FINAL_1695908224517_0.edn",536870969]],["^15",[753,"^3","{:highlights [{:id #uuid \"65160e02-19fd-4eea-bffe-cf767f1dd7ac\",\n               :page 1,\n               :position {:bounding {:x1 0,\n                                     :y1 -2,\n                                     :x2 669.496337890625,\n                                     :y2 649.484375,\n                                     :width 797,\n                                     :height 1127.1421084458777},\n                          :rects ({:x1 0,\n                                   :y1 -2,\n                                   :x2 0,\n                                   :y2 18,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}\n                                  {:x1 0,\n                                   :y1 0,\n                                   :x2 0,\n                                   :y2 0,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}\n                                  {:x1 120.515625,\n                                   :y1 563.84375,\n                                   :x2 543.9422607421875,\n                                   :y2 581.84375,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}\n                                  {:x1 120.515625,\n                                   :y1 586.34375,\n                                   :x2 559.14892578125,\n                                   :y2 604.34375,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}\n                                  {:x1 120.515625,\n                                   :y1 608.90625,\n                                   :x2 669.496337890625,\n                                   :y2 626.90625,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}\n                                  {:x1 144.609375,\n                                   :y1 631.484375,\n                                   :x2 264.95880126953125,\n                                   :y2 649.484375,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}),\n                          :page 1},\n               :content {:text \"1.

You will need to be able to identify a certain problem in the scenario given to you, find the main reason for that problem and propose a solution(s) to the problem that shows your understanding of different project management practises and approaches. You need to be able to justify your choice for the solution proposed. All assessments for SDM404 are integrated to help develop your skills in producing high quality software solutions in time and within budget. This assessment will help not only identify major problems that could happen during any software development project, but try to find causes and solutions to these problems in order to be able to complete the project successfully. .\"},\n               :properties {:color \"yellow\"}}\n              {:id #uuid \"65160e35-71ed-4cf4-80a0-6530d335f3c9\",\n               :page 1,\n               :position {:bounding {:x1 0,\n                                     :y1 -2,\n                                     :x2 669.496337890625,\n                                     :y2 649.484375,\n                                     :width 797,\n                                     :height 1127.1421084458777},\n                          :rects ({:x1 0,\n                                   :y1 -2,\n                                   :x2 0,\n                                   :y2 18,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}\n                                  {:x1 0,\n                                   :y1 0,\n                                   :x2 0,\n                                   :y2 0,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}\n                                  {:x1 128.62322998046875,\n                                   :y1 563.84375,\n                                   :x2 543.9422607421875,\n                                   :y2 581.84375,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}\n                                  {:x1 120.515625,\n                                   :y1 586.34375,\n                                   :x2 559.14892578125,\n                                   :y2 604.34375,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}\n                                  {:x1 120.515625,\n                                   :y1 608.90625,\n                                   :x2 669.496337890625,\n                                   :y2 626.90625,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}\n                                  {:x1 144.609375,\n                                   :y1 631.484375,\n                                   :x2 264.95880126953125,\n                                   :y2 649.484375,\n                                   :width 797,\n                                   :height 1127.1421084458777}),\n                          :page 1},\n               :content {:text \".

to decide where to get your lunch from so you want to get updates about lunch specials,…). o You want to follow up on your favourite sports results. o You want to create a simple game to play.● Think about the different approaches that would help you solve these problems or at least make it easier for the users using a software application. For each of the different solutions try to think about what resources you will need, how much time you need to prepare it, the cost, and what risks might slow down your progress.● Choose one of these solutions and base your proposal on it.
